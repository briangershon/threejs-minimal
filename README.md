# threejs-minimal

A minimal web project needed to run three.js experiments.

ES Modules. Hot reloading during development.

Builds with Webpack 5, intentionally using as many defaults as possible for smallest configuration file.

## Usage

npm start
```

You can view the development server at `localhost:8080`.

### Production build

npm run build
```

The deploy ends up in your `dist` folder.
